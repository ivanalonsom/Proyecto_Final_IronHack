# Two-Particle System: Analysis and Prediction of the Invariant Mass Based on Automated Learning

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis to examine how the various components of a particle influence each other during a collision with another particle. By employing both machine learning and deep learning techniques, we aim to predict the invariant mass of the resulting system. This study not only enhances our understanding of the dynamics involved in particle collisions but also seeks to develop accurate predictive models with significant applications in the field of particle physics.

## Motivation

The motivation for undertaking this project stems from its significant importance in advancing scientific knowledge and the high costs associated with such research. The aim is to construct a model capable of approximating the invariant mass of two particles without the need for all experimental data, relying instead on the movement of the particle along the beam direction and the charge of each particle.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is taken from CERN. For more details, visit the [CERN Open Data portal](https://opendata.cern.ch/record/304).
